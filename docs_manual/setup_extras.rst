Installing Extras
=================

This chapter gives technical information on how to install the VarFish extra services.
These are:

Jannovar REST Service (strongly recommended)
  molecular impact prediction for all affected transcripts

Exomiser REST Service
  required for phenotype-prioritization of variants using the `Exomiser <https://github.com/exomiser/Exomiser>`_.

CADD Annotation Service
  required for variant pathogenicity annotation with CADD scores.
  NB: this depends on `CADD-scripts <https://github.com/kircherlab/CADD-scripts>`_ which is only free for non-commercial use (see `license <https://github.com/kircherlab/CADD-scripts/blob/master/LICENSE>`_).

The audience of this chapter are those who want to install VarFish on their own infrastructure.
